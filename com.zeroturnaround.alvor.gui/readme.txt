GUI PLANS
---------

alvor.xml editor should be place for:
	- specifying configuration
	- enabling / disabling automatic checking


Full analysis
--------------
Goes together with: enabling checking, full (clean?) build, special button

TODO: create progress-bar 


SQL search feature (instead of all-hotspots view)


when automatic checking is re-enabled, then all changes made in the meanwhile are processed,
and further changes will be processed automatically
