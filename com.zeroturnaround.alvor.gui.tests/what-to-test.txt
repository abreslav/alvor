* full clean check gives correct markers
* appending an empty line to some files results in same markers
* prepending an empty line to some files results in markers, where line number is +1 and 
  rest is the same

* introducing sql error in previously correct hotspot gives new error marker(s) 
* fixing last error in an hotspot removes one error marker 

* same for warnings / unsupported constructs 

* introducing new correct / erroneous hotspot ...
* deleting correct / erroneous hotspot

* fixing a java error (many variations)

* editing and saving a file while Alvor is running should not cause trouble

* Is there possibility for some kind of deadlock? infinite looping? 


FULL ANALYSIS MARKER TESTS 
--------------------------
1) select a project or a source-folder
2) execute "Full analysis"
3) compare Alvor markers with expected markers  


INCREMENTAL ANALYSIS MARKER TESTS 
---------------------------------
1) Perform full analysis
2) Make a change in a file and save
3) Wait until builder completes
4) Compare markers with expected markers

test builder state:
	* make error, try to build, fix error (possibly by editing another file), try again to build


* test with Java errors !!

* test checking when code stays same but schema changes

Narrow, focused tests are performed on small artificial projects.

With big projects I test several things together.


* unit-test GuiChecker's ability to pass results from checkers to the GUI (without checking results themselves)
* unit-test Checker results in a separate checker test (bypassing GuiChecker)
* test strings in CrawlerTest 
* ...

* unit-test checker, crawler, GUI-checker with invalid inputs


Focus can affect CleanCheck command, so test with:

    * no open editors 
    * focus in editor, different project selected in package explorer

caching issues and incrementality
	* add new method
	* add new hotspot method
	* add second hotspot into a method
	* move file (using refactoring)


Configuration:
	* missing, incomplete or incorrect database configuration

TODO: What are the possible "wrong" ways to use the tool?


Update-site
	* test that updates are detected by "search for updates" 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
FOUND BUGS

* created a hotspot wrapper and then a callsite for it -- said at wrapped hotspot that
	"no callsites found"
