"hotspot": String expression of interest (argument expression to certain method call)

	In "Precise analysis of string expressions", http://www.brics.dk/JSA/ :
		"A program may contain many string expressions, but typically only few 
		expressions, called hotspots, for which we actually want to know the regular language."

"primary hotspot": hotspots that are to be found and analyzed 

"secondary hotspot": argument expression that affects the value of a "primary hotspot"

"full hotspot": should always evaluate to full SQL sentence

"partial hotspot": evaluates to part of a SQL sentence

Primary hotspots should be generally full hotspots, secondary hotspots can be either full
or partial. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

"hotspot pattern": description for finding hotspots, consists of class name, method name
	and argument index

"primary hotspot pattern": one of hotspot patterns given as input to the analyzer

"secondary hotspot pattern": used for finding secondary hotspots

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"hotspot target" : target method where value of the hotspot is passed to, described
   by hotspot pattern

"hotspot container": method containing the hotspot

"hotspot wrapper" : a hotspot container which gets (partial) hotspot value from parameter

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"string method" : method which constructs and returns a string or modifies a StringBuilder
argument.
